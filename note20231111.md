##configuring GPIO pins as output or input 
In embedded systems programming, configuring GPIO pins as output or input is a crucial aspect of controlling external devices or responding to external signals. In the code snippet you provided, it seems you are using the STM32 Cube Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) library to configure and control GPIO pins on an STM32 microcontroller.
Let's focus on the lines related to configuring GPIO pins as output:

      /* Configure GPIO pin Output Level */
      HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LED_GPIO_Port, LED_PIN, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
      HAL_GPIO_WritePin(DC_GPIO_Port, DC_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);
      HAL_GPIO_WritePin(RST_GPIO_Port, RST_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);
      HAL_GPIO_WritePin(CS_GPIO_Port, CS_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);
Here's an explanation of each line:

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LED_GPIO_Port, LED_PIN, GPIO_PIN_RESET);: This line sets the LED pin to a low logic level (GPIO_PIN_RESET), effectively turning off the LED if it is connected to this pin.

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(DC_GPIO_Port, DC_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);: This line sets the Data/Command (DC) pin to a high logic level (GPIO_PIN_SET), indicating that data is being sent (high) rather than a command (low) to a device, such as an LCD.

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(RST_GPIO_Port, RST_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);: This line sets the Reset (RST) pin to a high logic level (GPIO_PIN_SET), potentially bringing a device, like an LCD, out of a reset state.

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(CS_GPIO_Port, CS_PIN, GPIO_PIN_SET);: This line sets the Chip Select (CS) pin to a high logic level (GPIO_PIN_SET), indicating that the device is not selected (not active).

Configuring GPIO pins as output and setting their levels is essential because it allows you to control external hardware connected to these pins. In this case, you are likely configuring pins to interact with an LCD display and other peripherals. Different peripherals or devices may have specific requirements for signal levels and timing, and configuring GPIO pins correctly ensures proper communication and operation of these external components.
